🐍New Battlesnake player (You can find me [here](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/doodoal/) :D )
Thinking on implementing an AI-powered snake, but first, my main battlesnake ([Smarter Dummy](https://github.com/Doodoal/Smarter-dummy)) needs to be able to find food
Next-step would be to make it smarter enough to not trap itself. Will I then name it Smarter Smarter Dummy?👀
